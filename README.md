# NextGen-Encounters-Report-Editing
Automatically updates Qualified Encounters reports within the NextGen practice management system. 

Required packages:
  Pandas

Needed inputs:
  File path for Qualified Encounter report in csv format. 

My organization utilizes the practice management system, NextGen. NextGen has a front-end report runner that has the ability to pull of variety of canned reports. 
There is limited ability to edit the reports within the report runner. Analysts needing certain information need to pull a Qualified Encounter report and edit the csv file in Microsoft Excel.
Goal of this code is cut down on the amount of active work needed for individuals to edit a Qualified Encounters report.  Individuals can perform other tasks while waiting on the report to finish running.
